# HappinessCalculator
HappinessCalculator is an iOS app designed to quantify the happiness of a person over time.
This app was made in 2018, and hasn't been changed since.

## Download
Unfortunately HappinessCalculator was never accepted into the Apple App Store, and many features were therefore not developed on the app.

## Usage
Every day, the user indicates his level of happiness (on a 1-5 scale) and the app generates the Happiness trend of the person.
